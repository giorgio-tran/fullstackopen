# Full Stack Open Course
[This course](https://fullstackopen.com) covers React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript. It was kindly created by the University of Helsinki's faculty to provide people like myself an opportunity to learn modern web development at zero cost. 

This repository contains all of the assignments that I have completed. Some assignments build off of each other, and submissions can be traced via commits.
